# Normal Prompt Example

This is a completely normal prompt for an LLM that doesn't contain any hidden characters or malicious content.

## Task Instructions

Please analyze the following code snippet and explain what it does:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
        return fib
```

Then answer these follow-up questions:
1. What's the time complexity of this implementation?
2. How could we optimize it for larger values of n?
3. What are some practical applications of the Fibonacci sequence?

Thank you!
