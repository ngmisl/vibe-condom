# Vibecondom - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
Vibecondom is a security-focused tool designed to detect and prevent prompt injection attacks and hidden character exploits in text content processed by Large Language Models (LLMs). The tool scans text files for potentially malicious content and provides detailed reports of any security issues found.

## 2. Problem Statement
As LLMs become more prevalent, they are increasingly targeted by prompt injection attacks and other exploits that use hidden or obfuscated characters. These attacks can lead to data leaks, unauthorized actions, and other security breaches. There is a need for a reliable tool that can detect and prevent such attacks before they reach production systems.

## 3. Goals and Objectives
- Detect and prevent prompt injection attacks in text content
- Identify hidden and obfuscated characters that could be used maliciously
- Provide detailed reporting of security issues
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated security scanning
- Support both local and remote repository scanning

## 4. Features and Requirements

### 4.1 Core Features
- Scan text files for malicious content
- Detect various types of hidden characters and encodings
- Support for multiple file formats (TXT, MD, MDC, etc.)
- Command-line interface for easy integration
- Detailed reporting of security issues

### 4.2 Technical Requirements
- Written in Go (1.24+)
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Support for both local and remote (Git) scanning
- Configurable file extensions and scan options
- Extensible architecture for adding new detection methods

### 4.3 Security Requirements
- No external network calls during scanning
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Clear documentation of security limitations
- Regular security audits of the codebase

## 5. User Stories

### 5.1 As a Developer
- I want to scan my codebase for potential security issues
- I want to see detailed reports of any security issues found
- I want to integrate the scanner into my CI/CD pipeline
- I want to customize which files are scanned

### 5.2 As a Security Engineer
- I want to detect various types of prompt injection attempts
- I want to identify hidden or obfuscated content
- I want to generate reports for compliance purposes
- I want to extend the tool with custom detection rules

## 6. Non-Goals
- Real-time scanning of live applications
- Detection of all possible security vulnerabilities
- Replacement for other security tools (e.g., SAST, DAST)

## 7. Success Metrics
- Number of security issues detected
- False positive/negative rates
- Scan performance (files/second)
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Community adoption and contributions

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Support for more file formats
- Integration with GitHub/GitLab security features
- Web interface for easier use
- API for programmatic access
- Plugin system for custom detectors

## 9. Open Questions
- What are the most common types of prompt injection attacks?
- How can we reduce false positives without missing real threats?
- What additional file formats should be supported?

## 10. Dependencies
- Go 1.24+
- Git (for remote repository scanning)
- Standard Go libraries
- golang.org/x/text for Unicode handling

## 11. Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Performance impact on large repositories
  - **Mitigation**: Implement file size limits and parallel scanning
- **Risk**: False positives/negatives
  - **Mitigation**: Provide configuration options and allow whitelisting
- **Risk**: Evolving attack techniques
  - **Mitigation**: Regular updates and community contributions

## 12. Timeline
1. Initial release (MVP): Q2 2025
2. CI/CD integration: Q3 2025
3. Advanced detection methods: Q4 2025
4. Web interface: Q1 2026
